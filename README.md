# Bike Store Data Migration & Analysis (Part 2)
## This project focuses on the transition of a relational database from MySQL to SQLite to facilitate local data science workflows and in-depth business analysis using Python.

#📌 Project Overview
- The objective was to take an existing "Bike Store" database from a MySQL server and migrate its entire schema and dataset into an SQLite database file (bike_store.db). This allows for    more flexible analysis using Jupyter Notebooks without the need for a persistent server connection.

# 📂 Project Structure
- migrate.py: A Python script that handles the connection to MySQL, creates the equivalent schema in SQLite, and copies all records.
- bike_store_queries.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, revenue calculations, and visualizations.
- bike_store.db: The resulting SQLite database (generated by the migration script).

# ⚙️ Migration Process
## The migration was performed using the migrate.py script. It performs the following steps:
- Connects to a local MySQL instance.
- Maps MySQL data types (e.g., decimal, varchar, int) to compatible SQLite types.
- Automatically detects tables, primary keys, and data to recreate the database structure locally.
- Converts Decimal objects to floats to ensure compatibility with SQLite's storage engine.

# 📊 Data Analysis & Insights
- Once the data was moved to SQLite, the analysis was conducted using pandas, matplotlib, and sqlite3.
- Key Business Metrics.
  
## Based on the analysis in the notebook:
- Total Revenue:        $7,689,116.56
- Total Orders:         1,615
- Total Customers:      1,445
- Average Order Value:  $4,761.06
- Total Products Sold:  7,078 units

# Visualizations Included
## The project includes bar charts showing:
- Top 10 most sold products by quantity.
- Top 10 products by total revenue contribution.
- Top 5 Best Customers.
- Sales percentage by category regarding the amount of items sold.
- Sales percentage by category regarding the revenue made.
- Monthly Revenue Trend
- Top products with most revenue

# 🚀 How to Run
## Migration:
- Ensure you have MySQL running with the bike_store database.
- Update your credentials in migrate.py.
- Run python migrate.py.
  
## Analysis:
- Open bike_store_queries.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code.
- The notebook will automatically connect to the newly created bike_store.db file.

# 🛠 Libraries Used
- mysql-connector-python: For fetching data from the source.
- sqlite3: For local database management.
- pandas: For data manipulation and SQL querying.
- matplotlib: For generating business insight visualizations.
